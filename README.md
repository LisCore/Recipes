# Recipes
For this project, I am practicing the basics of using HTML. 
I have learned how to use lists and the markup needed for HTML use. 
The usage of elements and if needed, their attributes. 
Distinguished differing header styles for importance.
Lastly the use of href and src attributes to be relative links / images.
